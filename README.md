# face-detection-with-python
 Identify and recognize a person in the live real-time video.
 In this deep learning project, we will be able to recognize the human faces in live video with Python. I have built this project using python dlibâ€™s facial recognition network. Dlib is a general-purpose software library. Using dlib toolkit, we can make real-world machine learning applications.
